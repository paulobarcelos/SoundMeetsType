Here are some few instructions for Sound meets Type.

This experience requires a browser supporting WebGL - preferably Chrome.

Type a letter and choose the font weight you want. Then you choose a resolution. Different resolution setting gives different results. Press 'Rebuild' to update.

Play your preferable sound through the inbuilt microphone on your computer, and let the sound affect the letterform. Tip: If you have an earphone, you can use this as a mic, by plugging it into your computer and talking into the earpiece.

Play around with the different settings:
Material: Change material for different previews.
Elasticity:  Change the value to modify the behaviour of the letterform. Low values gives the letterform a plastic behaviour. High values gives it a elastic behaviour.

Play with the different pre-settings for 'bass', 'medium' and 'treble' to change how the sound is interacting with the letterform.

You can at any moment stop the interaction by clicking the on/off button. Download your result when you are satisfied.
Want to try another letterform? Remember to press 'Rebuild' after typing in the new letterform, so that the software updates.

Have fun!
